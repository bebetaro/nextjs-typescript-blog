### Just Complete

I just completed Next.js tutorial! ðŸ¤˜  
This tutorial is written by JavaScript and CSS Modules but I tried TypeScript and styled-components, And finally done it!

### Impression

This is so interesting tutorial and a lot of fun!  
Because I know React and TypeScript but I didn't know SSR & SSG...
However thorough this course, I learned both of them and when I should use SSG or not, or SSR or not. This knowledge is a big fruit of this lesson.

### Lastly

I'd like to study Next.js more and more.
Then I will brush up this blog more charming(Or perhaps I will make new repositoryðŸ˜¹)

Thank you, Vercel! Next.js is literally great framework!!
